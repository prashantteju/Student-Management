    <p>We believe the quality of a student is based on the early experiences in life which lays the foundation for all
        the learning and professionalism that follows. At D.Y. Patil Technical Campus, we cherish our role to deliver
        holistic, industry-centric and developmentally appropriate learning experiences. With a campus spread over 200
        acres of lush green land, we have based our approach upon three pillars: quality education, quality teachers,
        and quality Infrastructure.

        Our curriculum is designed under the leadership of Hon. Dr. Sanjay D Patil and it is intended to enable students
        to flourish academically, personally, socially and professionally. Our professors are facilitators who work in
        partnership with the students to develop and extend thinking through careful observation, documentation,
        thoughtful questions and deep reflections.

        We started D.Y Patil Technical Campus with a vision of providing a strong education base that would create
        creative thinkers, responsible global citizens, and life-long learners. We can proudly say that we have
        continued to provide our students with a nurturing environment.</p>

    <h5>Greeting...</h5>
    <p>I believe that the existence of every educational institute will continue only if that Institute makes the
        Student & Parent feel happy. The student & Parent will be happy only if they get their expectations fulfilled
        for which the student has taken an admission in the institute. This can be achieved only if every entity in an
        Institute works with their authorities executed 100% with the focus on quality. Therefore I request everyone to
        come together in achieving the target of HAPPY STUDENT, HAPPY PARENT, and Most preferred Institute.</p>
